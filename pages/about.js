        <p>The Yellow Pages is Basis Independent Fremont’s school newspaper, featuring engaging and relevant articles monthly (including but not limited to school events, current affairs, and entertainment). Being on the paper’s staff provides students with crucial life experiences, such as researching and developing communication skills with others. Members not only learn what it’s like to be part of a newspaper, but they also hone their writing skills, allowing them to grow in and outside of the classroom. </p>
