Recently, bookstores have become more and more accessible â€” Half-Price Books, Rumi Bookstore & Gifts, and DMCA Bookstore are just a few of the many well-known bookstores in the Fremont area. June 21, 2022 marked the opening of Banter Bookshop, a local, independently owned bookstore. A dream project of Amy Holmes Davis, the owner of Banter Bookshop, this shop provides customers with the latest book releases, including various genres for all ages. The small shop, located in the Downtown Fremont shopping district on Capitol Avenue, endows a homely and comfortable ambiance. Books are arranged and organized by genre and age group, complete with hand-drawn chalkboard signs. Perhaps the most appealing part of this shop is the personal touches, including minimalistic and unique deco and a small reading corner for younger children. The shop not only provides a multitude of books, but also sells gifts, games, and puzzles. Go check out Banter Bookshop or visit their website (https://banterbookshop.com/).
